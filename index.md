### Language and language topics are not islands

In my Spanish classroom, I firmly believe that language is not an isolated subject; instead, it is deeply intertwined with history, culture, art, politics, and the human experience. By presenting language as part of a larger, interconnected web, I help students see how their learning resonates beyond vocabulary and grammar, fostering a sense of relevance and curiosity. My lessons are designed to show that language is a bridge to understanding the world, offering students the tools to engage meaningfully with diverse perspectives.

I envision the classroom as a creative and dynamic space where students feel inspired to experiment with their language skills and express themselves authentically. Creativity allows students to break free from the fear of making mistakes, fostering a more engaging and supportive environment. I encourage them to approach challenges as opportunities for growth, and I design activities that spark their imagination.

### The beauty of the authentic

Authentic materials are central to my teaching philosophy. From news posts, video blogs, podcasts to poems and songs, I bring the real world into the classroom to create a more immersive experience. Authentic materials have their challenges as they are a form of "unsanitized" content that puts the listener away from any prescriptive language authority. In my class I drive students to engage with authentic material for them to realize that they are slowly building communication tools that can be used in real life from day one. Those resources not only improve students’ linguistic competence but also connect them with the cultural and social contexts of the Spanish-speaking world. By engaging with real-life content, students develop practical skills and a deeper appreciation for the cultures they are studying.

### Transverse knowledge

I also incorporate transversal elements into my lessons. In my lessons you will find recurring people such as singer-songwriter Jorge Drexler (Uruguay), Andrea Echeverri (Colombia),  or mexican actor Gael García Bernal. Also, places such as Bogotá, Buenos Aires, Machu Picchu, or themes such as Awards ceremonies and their role in the Hispanic world. Those elements create a sense of continuity and connection and can be revisited with different perspectives. These threads help students build upon prior knowledge and recognize patterns in language and culture. For example, a person, a song or a historical moment introduced in one lesson may reappear in later discussions, reinforcing key concepts while providing a richer, more layered understanding of the subject matter. This also provides a sense of intimate, shared, community knowlenge that becomes exclusive to a particular classroom on a particular semester.

### Lessons are not islands either

Each class is part of a larger educational journey. I approach teaching with the assumption of long-term interaction with my students, typically over the course of 16 weeks in a regular semester. This perspective allows me to scaffold lessons thoughtfully, ensuring that each session builds upon the last. It also helps me nurture a relationship with my students, adapting to their needs and growth over time, and emphasizing the importance of sustained effort in mastering a language.

### Music and language

Finally, my love for music and musicians infuses my teaching with energy and cultural depth. Music is a powerful tool for language learning, as it combines rhythm, melody, lyrics and storytelling to make vocabulary and expressions more memorable. By introducing students to songs and artists from diverse Spanish-speaking regions, I not only enhance their linguistic skills but also inspire an appreciation for the rich tapestry of cultures where Spanish is spoken.
